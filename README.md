### Hi, I'm Steven 👋

I am an ex-molecular/cell biologist learning to become a data analyst/deep learning practitioner. I love making beautiful data visualizations that tell data-rich and meaningful stories about complex topics like climate change, technology and social justice to name just a few. Some of my favorite tools here are matplotlib and altair, and I hope to get into D3 next. Another area I'm interested in is NLP because I just can’t get over how matrix multiplication can do awesome things like generate text. 

When I’m not doing nerdy data things, I like doing nerdy video game things. Currently I am playing Fallout 76, which is turning out to be a great stay-at-home activity. When I’m not being a nerd at all, I like to cook and bake, watch the Golden State Warriors play, taste cool new coffees, visit National Parks and pet dogs 🐶.
