I am a former molecular/cell biologist working in fintech to help companies build and launch financial products. I like to make charts and graphs from data-rich sources that tell meaningful stories about complex topics like climate change, the economy and social justice to name just a few. I also enjoy studying/learning about NLP and I hope to learn enough someday to apply it in my original field of biology.

When Iâ€™m not doing nerdy data things, I like to travel and see/learn more about the world, itâ€™s people, and culture. I am especially drawn to outdoor places like National Parks and my goal is to visit all of them someday. I like to cook and bake because I enjoy making things for other people, tasting cool new coffees and practicing my homebrewing, cheering on the Golden State Warriors, playing board games, being a plant parent, petting dogs, and searching for the biggest & baddest burritos.
